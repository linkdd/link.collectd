Welcome to link.collectd's documentation!
=========================================

CollectD is a daemon which collects system performance statistics periodically
and provides mechanisms to store the values in a variety of ways.

This library aims to provide an interface to build configurable Python plugins.

A configuration file will be read by the plugin, and the CollectD configuration
will extend it.

Check out the source code on Github_.
